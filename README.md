## üöÄ My Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm most proud of. Each one includes a description, features, and instructions on how to compile and run it.

### Project 1: Console Calculator

- **Description:** A simple, command-line calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations. This project was a great exercise in handling user I/O, input formatting, using `while` loops for continuous operation, and organizing code with header files.
- **Key Features:**
  - Supports five basic arithmetic operations.
  - User-friendly interface for continuous calculations.
  - Modular code structure using header files.
- **How to Compile & Run:**
  1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/SDaaim/C-Programs.git`
  2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd [Project-Directory-Name]`
  3.  Compile the source code using GCC:
      ```bash
      gcc calculator.c -o calculator
      ```
  4.  Run the application:
      ```bash
      ./calculator
      ```

### Project 2: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

- **Description:** A classic 2-player Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs directly in the console. This project demonstrates the use of 2D arrays to represent the game board and the implementation of game logic for win/draw detection.
- **Key Features:**
  - Interactive 2-player gameplay.
  - Uses a 3x3 array to manage the game state.
  - Includes robust logic to detect win conditions and draws.
- **How to Compile & Run:**
  ```bash
  # Compilation and execution steps
  gcc tictactoe.c -o tictactoe
  ./tictactoe
  ```

### Project 3: Student Record System

- **Description:** A console application for managing student records. This project showcases the use of `structs` to handle complex data and file I/O operations to persist data between sessions.
- **Key Features:**
  - Add, delete, edit, and search for student records.
  - Stores student information (e.g., name, ID, grades) in structs.
  - Saves and loads all records to and from a file, ensuring data persistence.
- **How to Compile & Run:**
  ```bash
  # Compilation and execution steps
  gcc student_system.c -o student_system
  ./student_system
  ```

### Project 4: To-Do List Manager

- **Description:** A command-line tool to help users keep track of their tasks. This project demonstrates dynamic memory allocation using a linked list or dynamic array to manage a list of tasks of any size.
- **Key Features:**
  - Add new tasks and mark existing tasks as "done" or "pending".
  - Saves the entire to-do list to a `.txt` file.
  - Uses dynamic data structures to handle a variable number of tasks.
- **How to Compile & Run:**
  ```bash
  # Compilation and execution steps
  gcc todo_list.c -o todo_list
  ./todo_list
  ```
- **Screenshots/GIFs:**

### Project 5: Number Guessing Game

- **Description:** A fun and simple game where the computer thinks of a number and the player has to guess it. This project focuses on random number generation and using conditional logic to provide feedback to the user.
- **Key Features:**
  - Generates a random number within a specified range.
  - Provides feedback to the player ("too high" or "too low").
  - Tracks the number of guesses the player takes.
- **How to Compile & Run:**
  ```bash
  # Compilation and execution steps
  gcc guessing_game.c -o guessing_game
  ./guessing_game
  ```
- **Screenshots/GIFs:**
